h1. CakeAdmin Plugin

The best way to generate an awesome backend. Under heavy development.

h2. Background

I'm jealous of Django admin and think @cake bake@ is not the greatest to work with. So I started toying with my own "app skeleton":http://github.com/josegonzalez/app_skellington. I realized halfway through that it sucks to base everything on the DB. What if I want to include behaviors other than those included in app_skellington? Impossible.

So I started work on a Django admin for CakePHP. Here is the beginning of that. And it will rule. And you will love me. And you'll make oodles of cash from this likely. I'm hoping some of this goes to me, but I can dream, can't I?

h2. Requirements

* CakePHP 1.3
* Patience

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_admin/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @cake_admin@

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_admin.git plugins/cake_admin
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_admin.git cake_admin</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Create a folder in your @app/libs@ folder called @admin@. This folder will contain all of your @CakeAdmin@ classes. We'll use a @Post@ model for our example admin section.

Create a @post_admin.php@ file in your @app/libs/admin@ folder. This will contain your @PostAdmin@ class. "This gist":http://gist.github.com/583603 is an example of such a class.

Once your @post_admin.php@ file has been created, run @cake admin@ from the shell. This will create the respective plugin if not already (in our case, an @admin@ plugin), as well as all the models, views, and controllers for ALL available @*_admin.php@ files. In our case, you can then access the admin section at @example.com/admin/posts@.
